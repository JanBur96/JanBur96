# Hello and welcome to my GitHub page 👋🏼

### Who are you 🤨?

I'm Jan! I'm an aspiring Web-Developer which found his passion in coding.

### What are you learning/doing at the moment 🧐?

Though Question! There are a lot of things I'm currently doing. But I've made a list for you:

* I'm focusing on learning vanilla JavaScript. 
* I'm also improving my UI/UX Design skills together with CSS.
* Another thing I'm doing is to network with other developer on Twitter and I try to grow a "little" community.
* As a fan of the "Feynman Technique" I'm also already trying to mentor/teach people, which have less knowledge than me.

When it comes to picking a framework I already made a decision: React. But before learning React I want to have a good knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and how it's working behind the scenes.

### Do you have any cool projects you can show us 🤓?

If have a lot of projects, since I'm using them to learn! Well... are they cool? I don't know I let you decide:

* My own Website (🚧)
* Exchange Rate Calculator (✅)
* Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (✅)
* Tic-Tac-Toe Game (✅)

I also have Design projects! You can view them on my website.

_Just because some projects are finished for now it doesn't mean that they're completely finished. Some projects may still have some bugs to fix and of course you also could add some new features!_
