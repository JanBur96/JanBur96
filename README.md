# Hello and welcome to my GitHub page 👋🏼

### Who are you 🤨?

I'm __Jan__! I'm a __Web Developer__ which found his passion in coding. My Motto is: I can't learn everything... but I will try my best to learn as much as possible!

### What are you learning/doing at the moment 🧐?

Tough Question! There are a lot of things I'm currently doin, but I've made a list for you:

* I'm focusing on learning __Vue, Nuxt, NodeJS and MongoDB__ for Fullstack Development. 
* I'm also learning __Python__ on the side (as a "hobby") since I'm curious about how Automation and Machine Learning with Python works.
* Another thing I'm doing is to __network with other developers__ on Twitter and LinkedIn and try to grow a "little" community.
* As a fan of the "Feynman Technique" I'm already trying to __mentor/teach developers__, which have less knowledge than me.

I'm also interested in learning __Figma/Adobe XD__ for __wireframing__.

### Do you have any cool projects you can show us 🤓?

I have plenty of projects, since that's how I learn - by doing projects! Well... are they cool or good? I don't know you can check them out for yourself and decide:

* My own Website (✅) - https://jan-web.dev

__Fullstack Projects are coming soon__

And there are plenty more! Just check out my repositories here on GitHub.

_Just because some projects are finished for now, it doesn't mean that they're completely finished. Certain projects may still have bug fixes left and of course, could also have added some new features to them!_

### What are your goals 🎯?

* Earning my own money as a Web Developer in 2021.
