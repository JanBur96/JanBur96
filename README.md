# Hello and welcome to my GitHub page 👋🏼

### Who are you 🤨?

I'm __Jan__! I'm an aspiring __Web-Developer__ which found his passion in coding.

### What are you learning/doing at the moment 🧐?

Tough Question! There are a lot of things I'm currently doin, but I've made a list for you:

* I'm focusing on learning __vanilla JavaScript__. 
* I'm also improving my UI/UX __Design__ skills together with CSS.
* Another thing I'm doing is to __network with other developers__ on Twitter and try to grow a "little" community.
* As a fan of the "Feynman Technique" I'm already trying to __mentor/teach developers__, which have less knowledge than me.

When it comes to picking a framework I already made a decision: React. But before learning React I want to have a good knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and how it's working behind the scenes.

### Do you have any cool projects you can show us 🤓?

If have a lot of projects, since I'm using them to learn! Well... are they cool? I don't know I let you decide:

* My own Website (🚧).
* Exchange Rate Calculator (✅).
* Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (✅).
* Tic-Tac-Toe Game (✅).

I also have Design projects! You can view them on my website.

_Just because some projects are finished for now it doesn't mean that they're completely finished. Some projects may still have some bugs to fix and of course you also could add some new features!_

### What are your goals 🎯?

* Earning my own money as a Web-Developer in 2021.
* Studying CS at an University.
* Meeting new developer all-around the globe.
* Mentoring rookies.
