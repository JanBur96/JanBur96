# Hello and welcome to my GitHub page 👋🏼

### Who are you 🤨?

I'm __Jan__! I'm an aspiring __Web-Developer__ which found his passion in coding.

### What are you learning/doing at the moment 🧐?

Tough Question! There are a lot of things I'm currently doin, but I've made a list for you:

* I'm focusing on learning __vanilla JavaScript__. 
* I'm also improving my UI/UX __Design__ skills together with CSS.
* Another thing I'm doing is to __network with other developers__ on Twitter and try to grow a "little" community.
* As a fan of the "Feynman Technique" I'm already trying to __mentor/teach developers__, which have less knowledge than me.

When it comes to picking a framework I already made a decision: React. But before learning React I want to have a good knowledge of vanilla JavaScript and how it's working behind the scenes.

### Do you have any cool projects you can show us 🤓?

If have plenty of projects, since that's how I learn - by doing projects! Well... are they cool? I don't know you can check them out for yourself and decide:

* My own Website (🚧).
* Exchange Rate Calculator (✅).
* Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (✅).
* Tic-Tac-Toe Game (✅).

I likewise have Design projects! You can view them on my website.

_Just because some projects are finished for now, it doesn't mean that they're completely finished. Certain projects may still have bug fixes left and of course, could also have added some new features to them!_

### What are your goals 🎯?

* Earning my own money as a Web-Developer in 2021.
* Studying CS at an University.
* Meeting and getting to know developers all-around the globe.
* Mentoring rookies.
